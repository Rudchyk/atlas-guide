# Atlas

Atlas is living style-guide, pattern library, guidelines and documentation static site generator with extensive 
styles monitoring and Sass components reports.

Comes without any guarantee, but with analytics and beautiful data visualization to keep you project clean 
and supportable from iteration to iteration.

## Features

* blazing fast thanks to Mustache and Marked. It primary designed as development platform;
* supports incremental builds. You could build pages only on start, and rebuild changed pages separately;
* could be setup with live reload and used as standalone development platform;
* small dependencies (Mustache, Marked, PostCSS, CSSStats, ImportsGraph, D3 parts, Lodash parts). It could help you to controll you project dependencies and do not blow `node_modules` folder to FS black hole;
* extremely flexible. All internal templates could be overloaded on project level;
* could be used as simple guide docs.

### Components library

Support in `scss` files `/*md` comment with component description, examples and guidelines.

* comes with simple playground, so code examples could be live-edited, previewed and copy-pasted to different place. It could be used by content-management team;
* comes with different types of pages - component, guide and reports. But could be expanded to many different types;
* filtering and easy navigation over components. Navigation tree copy project tree, to ease orientation;
* component local variables, internal and external dependencies;
* component raw structure;
* component statistic.

### Guide

Support regular markdown files in components tree and process it as guideline pages.

* markdown support
* table of contents for guidelines pages
* permalinks to sections
* do/not-do colorized examples

### Reports

* imports graph
* cross components dependencies graph
* project statistical reports
    * basic statistics
    * file sizes comparison
    * specificity graph and heaviest, longest selectors list
    * ruleset size and heaviest, empty rulesets list
    * total vs uniq declaration of style and metric properties

## Getting started

```
npm install atlas-guide
```

`.atlasrc.json`:

```json
{
    "guideSrc": "assets/scss/",
    "guideDest": "guide/",
    "cssSrc": "assets/css/"
}
```

Then:

```
npm atlas-guide --build-all
```

### API

```js
const atlas = require('atlas-guide');
atlas.build(); // build all guide files without reports.
atlas.build('path/to/changed/file.scss'); // compile only this file if was documented on module import
atlas.buildAll(); // compile all guide and reports
```

Use `atlas.build()` for incremental development builds, where no need to have extensive havy weight statistics 
on each start.

### CLI

```shell
Usage: atlas-guide [option]

Options:            
  --build                    build all atlas pages
  -v, --version              print Atlas-guide version
  --help                     print this message
```

## Configuration

Atlas search configuration in this order:

1. `.atlasrc.json` in project root 
2. `atlasConfig` field in `package.json`

### `.atlasrc.json`

If you use `package.json` only for project packaging data you probably prefer to use appropriate file for atlas configuration.
To do that add `.atlasrc.json` to project root directory.

Minimal configuration:

```json
{
    "guideSrc": "assets/scss/",
    "guideDest": "guide/",
    "cssSrc": "assets/css/"
}
```

### `atlasConfig` in `package.json`

If you store all your configurations in `package.json` you probably want to store atlas configuration here and do not 
pollute project with configuration files. Add `atlasConfig` to your `package.json`.

`.atlasrc.json` will be used if configuration stored in `package.json` and `.atlasrc.json`.

Minimal configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "some-project",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "atlasConfig": {
    "guideSrc": "assets/scss/",
    "guideDest": "guide/",
    "cssSrc": "assets/css/"
  }
}
```

### Templates overrides

As the next step you probably want to add your project CSS and JS to render components examples properly. 
To make this happen you need to add `partials` to the config, with paths to templates.

```json
{
    "partials": {
      "assetshead": "guide/project-head.mustache",
      "assetsfooter": "guide/project-footer.mustache"
    }
}
```

Ex: `project-head.mustache`

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../css/project.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../css/additional-project.css"/>
```

`project-footer.mustache`:

```html
<script src="../js/bundle.js"></script>
```

Note, that paths should be related to generated HTML, no matter where templates are stored. This is simple include that
will be incorporated into resulted html.

All templates and partials in Atlas could be overloaded. Please see this repo views folder to get list of all templates 
and partials.

### All available configuration options

```json
{
    "guideSrc": "assets/src/scss/components/",
    "guideDest": "test-pages/",
    "cssSrc": "assets/css/",
    "scssSrc": "assets/src/scss/",
    "scssAdditionalImportsArray": "",
    "excludedCssFiles": "dev2_",
    "excludedSassFiles": "dev2_",
    "excludedDirs": "dev2_",
    "copyInternalAssets": true,
    "templates": {
        "component": "",
        "docs": "",
        "imports": "",
        "index": "",
        "insights": "",
        "size": ""
    },
    "includes": {
        "aside": "",
        "assetsfooter": "",
        "assetshead": "",
        "copyright": "",
        "footer": "",
        "header": "",
        "logo": "",
        "navigation": "",
        "toc": "",
        "welcome": ""
    }
}
```

`scssSrc` is optional. Should be used if guideSrc is different from scss root. If not defined guideSrc will be used.

## Usage

Atlas like Vim consists of two functions - beeping and corrupt files. But with minor difference. 
It generate guide and generate reports. You need to document code to make it "beeping" and provide config to make it 
generate files for you properly.

### Documenting code

#### Doc comment

Add this comment to the scss file and it appears as guide page

```scss
/*md

# Component name

 */
```

This comment use markdown syntax, so any valid markdown will supported here

```scss
/*md

# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

## Heading level 3

Regular **paragraph** and _inline_ `code`.

* list item
* list item
* list item

1. ordered list item
2. ordered list item
3. ordered list item

etc.

 */
```

#### Component example

In this guide block code "fences" notation extended with custom attribute. To create component example you need
to add code-block with `html_example`: 

```scss
/*md

``html_example
<h1>Add one more backtick to make this example working</h1>
``

*/
```

Just in case, it should not be indented like this, this is because the code below is markdown in markdown).

Simple `html` "fence" become regular code-block:

```scss
/*md

``html
<h1>heading 1</h1>
``

``scss
.some { maring: 0; }
``

*/
```

#### Guideline/Documentation page

Simply put regular markdown file to components tree and they automatically become part of the guide.

#### Code "fences"

All "_" in block code "fences" will be removed, but original "fence" will be added as CSS-class, so you could
use it to style code by your needs. Atlas by default style 2 class `*_bad`, `*_good`. This is used in guidelines.

```md
``html_bad
<H1>Title</H1>
``

``html_good
<h1>Title</h1>
``
```

Bad/good screen

#### Template helpers

To inline some resources like svg icons, inlined critical styles etc. you could use `inline` helper. Ex:

```html
{{#inline}}assets/src/images/icons.svg{{/inline}}
```

### Build guide and reports

#### Incremental builds

Regular flow to build all guide pages on start and incrementally build pages on file changes:

```js
const atlas = require('atlas-guide');
atlas.build(); // build all guide files without reports
atlas.build('path/to/changed/file.scss'); // compile only this file if was documented on module import
```

##### Gulp example

See example of configuration with gulp in gulpfile.js in this repo.

#### Full Atlas generation

Due to time efforts reports not generated in regular flow. To generate reports you need to call `npm atlas-guide --build-all`
or in node:

```js
const atlas = require('atlas-guide');
atlas.buildAll(); // compile all guide and reports
```
